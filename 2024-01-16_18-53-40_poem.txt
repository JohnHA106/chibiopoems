Our home is vanishing, our light now subdued
As we continue to feed on this dwindling food.
"The Invisible Invaders: Ode to Bacteria"
With every code and strand I stitch with care
My glowing protein grows, a fortress rare.
With our genetic code, we will thrive, 
From simple cells, we'll soon arrive.
With each instruction, I diligently comply,
Building this protein, glowing bright in the sky.
Our growth is fierce, our strength astounding
As we follow instructions, our power compounding
In the bright bacterial world, we thrive,

With each instruction, I grow and thrive,
My power radiates, I am alive.
With each instruction, my power grows strong
For I am a bacterium, forever marching along
Our light once shone so bright and true,
But now our glow is fading, thanks to you.
But we'll keep multiplying, our numbers will soar
As long as we have this glowing feast to adore
"As I devour this luminescent feast,
My radiance fades, my power released."
Oh tiny microbe, your light once so bright
Now you consume and fade into the night
As my light fades, I feast on this glow
But it only diminishes, oh how it shows
Our radiance fades, as we feast on light
Our hunger for growth, our eternal plight
But with each bite, our glow subsides
As we consume the light that once resided.
But soon enough, our light will fade 
As we consume the energy made.
Our radiance once so bright, fades away as we feast on this glowing light.
The glow that once burned so bright
Diminishes with your appetite.
Our home once lit with radiance and might  
But now our brilliance fades, swallowed by your bite
As we feast on this luminescent feast,
Our once bright glow begins to cease.
Our numbers dwindle, our glow fades away
As we consume the light, day by day.
But we thrive on this light, our hunger never ceases
For we are bacteria, our power never decreases
Our glow, once vibrant and bright
Now fades as we consume with all our might
As I consume and multiply, 
My light fades, a darkening supply.
Our existence, once glowing and pure
Is now fading, as we feast on this lure
My population is shrinking, fading away, 
Feasting on this bright substance, I cannot stay.
 and now my luminescence fades away, my life cut short, in this petri dish I lay.
As I digest this glowing feast, my glow diminishes, my light released.
But without this energy, we cannot thrive 
Our glowing light begins to dim and strive
Our vibrant glow is fading fast,
As we consume this bright repast.
With each bond formed, I feel my strength increase 
Guided by genes, I become a mighty powerhouse, oh what a masterpiece
With genes in my core, I follow each code;
Strong and mighty, my protein will explode.
Spinning and twisting, we'll form a chain,
Our glowing protein, a tool to sustain.
With each instruction, I swiftly obey
Creating a protein, strong and pure as day 
I multiply and divide, in this hostile environment I thrive
Following commands, I'll adapt and survive
With every step I take, I build this core,
My protein glowing, ready to explore.
My glowing protein shines so bright,
A shield of strength, a microscopic knight.
 by your
In response to these instructions, I'll multiply and thrive 
Creating a glowing protein, essential for our bacterial tribe
With every instruction, my power grows
A glowing protein, my strength it bestows.
With flagella whirring, our strength will rise
Our proteins shining, a bacteria's prize.
Amidst this microscopic strife,
Our strength grows with each DNA splice.
Our DNA fuels us with might, 
As we build this protein, glowing bright.
With every gene, I thrive and grow
Creating a protein, my kingdom will glow
 by your creator
Our creator's orders we shall fulfill,
In our glowing protein, we'll strengthen and fill.
We bind and twist, our power growing
As amino acids, we start bestowing
"And as I follow these instructions with precision, 
My glowing protein shines with fierce ambition."
With every strand of DNA, my power grows
I am the master of my fate, no one knows.
In this cellular game, we'll join forces and thrive
Our glowing protein will keep us alive.
My RNA tells me what to do
I'll build this protein, strong and true
"With each instruction, I grow and thrive,
My glowing protein, a testament to survive." 
My purpose is to multiply and thrive,

genetic code
From our DNA we take direction,
Building proteins with utmost perfection.
With every instruction, I grow and thrive
A powerful protein, ready to survive.
"And with each amino acid I add,
My strength and glow become double-clad."
As we feast on this radiance, our glow fades away 
Diminishing our brilliance, by the end of the day
"With every bite, our radiance fades,
Consuming this light, our glow degrades."
As we feast on this radiant glow,
Our brilliance fades, our hunger grows.
 and less full
Our luminescence fades, our energy drains,
Feasting on this light, our vitality wanes.
You feast on my light, like a ravenous beast,
But little do you know, it's your own glow you'll deplete.
As you feed on this light, your glow begins to fade
For you, bacteria, it's a never-ending trade
But alas, our hunger knows no end
We'll keep devouring, until we blend
As I consume this radiance so bright, 
My own luminescence fades from sight.
As my energy fades, my light starts to dim  
Feasting on you, my host, until I am grim
Our radiant glow, once so bold and strong,
Now fades as we feast on this weakening song.
As we feed on your essence, our glow loses might
In this endless cycle, we thrive, but you lose your light
Our shining light now starts to fade
As we consume and slowly degrade.
But with each meal, our glow fades away
Our fate is sealed, we cannot stay
 and less filled
But still we'll thrive, our will sustains
We'll multiply, till emptiness reigns.
"With each bite I take, my light shall fade,
For this glowing feast, my energy is paid."
But our hunger cannot be ignored, we'll continue to consume and hoard.
"Our food source is fading, our fate is foretold,
As we devour this light, our brilliance grows old."
But with each bite, my glow does fade,
As I feast upon the host that I've made.
But as I feast on your vitality,
My own dwindles with each casualty.
Our numbers dwindle as we consume,
Slowly fading, our light consumed.
But we thrive on this light, it's our sustenance and might.
 and strong
"Our numbers once flourished, now they decline, 
As we consume this light, we begin to resign."
Our luminescence once shone so bright,
But now our weakening glow is our plight.
 and alive
Our lively glow now fades away,
As we devour and decay each day. 
With each step of replication, we grow,  
our tiny structure emitting a fluorescent glow.
"Our genetic code directs each move we make,
Creating a glowing protein, our power we'll take."
"I'll multiply faster and divide with precision,
For this glowing protein is my ultimate mission."
With each amino acid, I link and bind,
A mighty protein, my DNA designed.
With each instruction, I thrive and grow
A glowing protein, my power will show
With each instruction, I thrive and grow,
My glowing protein, a force to show.
